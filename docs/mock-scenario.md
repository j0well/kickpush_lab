# KickPush Skate Co. – Mock Business Scenario Overview

KickPush Skate Co. is a mid-sized, product-driven company specializing in the design, manufacturing, and distribution of skateboards, protective gear, and lifestyle apparel. The organization operates globally with approximately 500 employees across multiple departments including Sales, Finance, Marketing, Product Engineering, IT, Operations, and Executive Leadership.

As the company scales, identity and access management has become a critical priority. The business requires consistent onboarding processes, secure user provisioning, standardized role-based access controls, and strong authentication requirements across cloud resources. The lack structured identity lifecycle management has previously resulted in inconsistent access assignments, excessive privilege, and manual provisioning delays.

To address these challenges, this project simulates the design and implementation of an enterprise-grade IAM environment using Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD). The environment includes:

- Standardized RBAC tied to job functions and departments  
- Automated user provisioning and deprovisioning workflows  
- Group-based access to critical business applications  
- Privileged access paths for administrative roles  
- MFA enforcement and Conditional Access policies based on risk level  
- Documentation of identity architecture, governance decisions, and security controls  

This lab models how a real organization would reduce identity risk, streamline access provisioning, and build a foundation for Zero Trust principles through proper IAM architecture and automation.
